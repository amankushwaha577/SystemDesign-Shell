Types of Sharding 🚀  

Sharding can be implemented in different ways depending on how data is distributed across shards. The most common types of sharding are:  

1. Horizontal Sharding (Scaling) :
---------------------------------
Data is split by rows/range, storing different types of data in different shards.  

📌 Example:  
    a. Stores all users and their posts in one database.  
    b. As the number of users increases, **queries become slow**.  

    users_table (Before Sharding)  
    | user_id | username | email          | profile_pic       | content         | likes | comments |
    |---------|---------|---------------|------------------|----------------|-------|----------|
    | 1       | JohnDoe  | john@email.com | john_pic.jpg     | "Hello World!"  | 25    | 5        |
    | 2       | Alice99  | alice@mail.com | alice_pic.jpg    | "My first post" | 30    | 8        |
    | 3       | Mike21   | mike@mail.com  | mike_pic.jpg     | "Nice weather"  | 20    | 3        |
    | 4       | EmmaK    | emma@mail.com  | emma_pic.jpg     | "Love this!"    | 50    | 10       |

🔴 Problems with a Single Database:  
-----------------------------------
    a. 🚨 **Too many users** slow down the database.  
    b. 🚀 **Hard to scale** because all users are stored in one place.  
    c. ❌ **More downtime** if the database becomes overloaded.  

✅ After Horizontal Sharding (Users Distributed Across Multiple Databases) :

    🟢 Shard 1 (users_db_1) - Stores users with user_id 1 to 2
    | user_id | username | email          | profile_pic       |
    |---------|---------|---------------|------------------|
    | 1       | JohnDoe  | john@email.com | john_pic.jpg     |
    | 2       | Alice99  | alice@mail.com | alice_pic.jpg    |

    🟢 Shard 2 (users_db_2) - Stores users with user_id 3 to 4 
    | user_id | username | email         | profile_pic       |
    |---------|---------|--------------|------------------|
    | 3       | Mike21  | mike@mail.com  | mike_pic.jpg     |
    | 4       | EmmaK   | emma@mail.com  | emma_pic.jpg     |

    🟢 Shard 1 (posts_db_1) - Stores posts for users 1 to 2 
    | post_id | user_id | content         | likes | comments |
    |---------|---------|----------------|-------|----------|
    | 101     | 1       | "Hello World!"  | 25    | 5        |
    | 102     | 2       | "My first post" | 30    | 8        |

    🟢 Shard 2 (posts_db_2) - Stores posts for users 3 to 4 
    | post_id | user_id | content         | likes | comments |
    |---------|---------|----------------|-------|----------|
    | 103     | 3       | "Nice weather"  | 20    | 3        |
    | 104     | 4       | "Love this!"    | 50    | 10       |

✅ **Advantages of Horizontal Sharding:**  
----------------------------------------  
🔹 **Better Load Distribution** – Queries are divided across multiple databases.  
🔹 **Improved Performance** – Each database has **fewer rows**, making lookups faster.  
🔹 **Easy Scalability** – More shards can be added as the user base grows.  
🔹 **Less Downtime** – If one shard fails, others still function normally.

2. Vertical Sharding  :
---------------------- 
🔹 How It Works:  
   Data is split by feature/column, storing different types of data in different shards.  

📌 Example:  
    a. User profiles stored in one database.  
    b. Post stored in another database.

    users_table (Before Sharding) -
    | user_id | username | email          | profile_pic       | content         | likes | comments |
    |---------|---------|---------------|------------------|----------------|-------|----------|
    | 1       | JohnDoe  | john@email.com | john_pic.jpg     | "Hello World!"  | 25    | 5        |
    | 2       | Alice99  | alice@mail.com | alice_pic.jpg    | "My first post" | 30    | 8        |

🔴 Problems with a Single Database: 
-----------------------------------
    a. As posts increase, **queries become slower**.  
    b. User data and posts are mixed , **making it inefficient to scale**.  
    c. Harder to cache **frequently accessed user data** separately. 

    Shard1 : users_table - 
    | user_id | username | email          | profile_pic       |
    |---------|---------|---------------|------------------|
    | 1       | JohnDoe  | john@email.com | john_pic.jpg     |
    | 2       | Alice99  | alice@mail.com | alice_pic.jpg    |

    SHard2 : posts_table -
    | post_id | user_id | content         | likes | comments |
    |---------|---------|----------------|-------|----------|
    | 101     | 1       | "Hello World!"  | 25    | 5        |
    | 102     | 2       | "My first post" | 30    | 8        |

✅ Advantages of Vertical Sharding:  
------------------------------------
a. **Faster Queries** – User-related queries don’t mix with post-related queries.  
b. **Scalability** – Posts database can be scaled separately.  
c.  **Efficient Caching** – Frequently accessed user data can be cached separately.

3. Hash-Based Sharding  
🔹 How It Works:  
- A hash function is used to distribute data evenly across shards.  
- The hash function takes a key (e.g., user_id) and maps it to a shard.  

📌 Example:  
shard_id = hash(user_id) % total_shards  
- User with user_id = 101 goes to Shard 1  
- User with user_id = 202 goes to Shard 2  

✅ Pros:  
- Even data distribution, preventing hotspots.  
- Scalable for large systems with unpredictable access patterns.  

❌ Cons:  
- Adding new shards requires resharding (recalculating hash mappings).  
- Hard to perform range queries efficiently.  

4. Directory-Based Sharding  
🔹 How It Works:  
- Uses a lookup table (metadata store) to map records to specific shards.  

📌 Example:  
- A mapping table keeps track of which shard contains which user.  
  | user_id | shard_id |  
  |---------|---------|  
  | 101     | Shard 1 |  
  | 202     | Shard 2 |  

- Application queries the directory first to find the correct shard.  

✅ Pros:  
- Flexible and allows dynamic shard management.  
- Easy to add or remove shards without massive data migration.  

❌ Cons:  
- The lookup table is a single point of failure if not replicated properly.  
- Adds an extra lookup step for each query, increasing latency.  

Comparison of Sharding Types  

| Sharding Type       | Pros | Cons | Best For |  
|---------------------|------|------|----------|  
| Range-Based        | Simple, good for range queries | Hotspots if data is unevenly distributed | Ordered datasets (e.g., time-series data) |  
| Vertical           | Optimized storage for different data types | Limited scalability, complex joins | Multi-feature applications (e.g., social networks) |  
| Hash-Based         | Even load distribution, no hotspots | Hard to do range queries, costly resharding | Large-scale applications (e.g., e-commerce, social media) |  
| Directory-Based    | Flexible, easy to add shards | Extra lookup overhead, risk of failure | Dynamic scaling environments |  

Which Sharding Type Should You Use?  
✅ Use Range-Based Sharding if you need efficient range queries and sequential data access.  
✅ Use Vertical Sharding if your data is naturally divided into separate features (e.g., user profiles vs. transactions).  
✅ Use Hash-Based Sharding if you want even load distribution and random access patterns.  
✅ Use Directory-Based Sharding if your system needs dynamic scalability with flexible shard management.
