Sharding is a technique for Horizontally scaling data.
where data is split into multiple data instance or shards.
Eeach shard is stored in different Databases of servers.

Logic : SUppose we have 20 rows in Data.
        we divided our data in 4 shards.
        Than every shard will have 5 rows.

Best Practices for Implementing Sharding :
-----------------------------------------
✅ Use a Good Shard Key: 
        1. A specific column or attribute (e.g., user ID, geographic location) used to determine how data is partitioned across shards.
        2. Choosing a good shard key is critical to ensure even distribution of data and load.
        3. In future for join query these shard keys will be used querying data from multiple shards.

✅ Use Consistent Hashing: Helps in rebalancing when adding new shards.
✅ Implement Monitoring: Track shard performance to detect load imbalances.
✅ Minimize Cross-Shard Operations: Design queries to operate within a single shard whenever possible.


6. When to Use Sharding? :
---------------------------
1. Handling Large User Bases: Social media platforms, SaaS applications.
2. High-Volume Transaction Systems: Payment gateways, e-commerce.
3, Big Data & Analytics: Distributed log processing, machine learning workloads.


Why Use Sharding? :
------------------
1. Scalability: Distributes data and load across multiple servers, enabling the system to handle more data and traffic.
2. Performance: Reduces query latency by limiting the amount of data each server needs to process.
3. High Availability & Fault Tolerance: Failure in one shard does not impact the entire system.
4. Cost Efficiency: Allows the use of smaller, cheaper servers instead of a single large, expensive machine.


Disadvantages of Sharding 🚨 :
-----------------------------
1. Operational Complexity :
        a. Difficult Setup & Maintenance: Setting up sharding requires careful planning of shard keys and data distribution.
        b. Complex Migrations: Moving data between shards is difficult, especially when rebalancing shards.
        c. Increased Monitoring Needs: Requires continuous monitoring to detect uneven shard loads and failures.

2. Querying Becomes Complex :
        a. Cross-Shard Joins Are Expensive: Queries involving multiple shards require additional logic at the application level.
        b. Aggregation Issues: Computing totals (e.g., counting all users) requires fetching data from all shards.

3. Data Consistency Issues :
        a. Distributed Transactions Are Hard: Transactions across multiple shards require two-phase commit (2PC), which adds latency.
        b. Increased Risk of Data Inconsistencies: If a shard fails, data synchronization across shards becomes challenging.

4. Rebalancing is Costly :
        a. Shard Splitting is Difficult: When a shard becomes too large, redistributing its data without downtime is complex.
        b. Scaling Up Requires Planning: Adding new shards means redistributing existing data, which can cause downtime or temporary performance degradation.

5. Single Point of Failure (Metadata/Shard Map Server) :
        a. Directory-Based Sharding Needs a Lookup Table: If the shard mapping metadata store fails, it affects the whole system.
        b. Coordination Overhead: Keeping track of where each piece of data resides requires additional infrastructure.

6. High Infrastructure Cost
        a. More Servers Required: Each shard operates as an independent database, leading to higher hardware and maintenance costs.
        b. Increased Network Latency: More inter-shard communication increases data retrieval time in distributed environments.


When Should You Avoid Sharding? ❌ :
-------------------------------------
1. If a single database can handle the load with replication and indexing.
2. If your application relies on frequent joins and aggregations.
3. If you lack the expertise to maintain a distributed database.
