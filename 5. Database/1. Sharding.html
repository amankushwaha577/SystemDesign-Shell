<!-- 
Sharding is a technique for Horizontally scaling data.
where data is split into multiple data instance or shards.
Eeach shard is stored in different Databases of servers.

Logic : SUppose we have 20 rows in Data.
        we divided our data in 4 shards.
        Than every shard will have 5 rows.
