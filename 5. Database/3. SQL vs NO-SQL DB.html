<!-- 
1. SQL Databases (Relational) :
------------------------------
SQL databases use structured schemas and follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. 
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle DB. 

Advantages:
-----------
✅ Structured Data – Uses tables with predefined schemas.
✅ ACID Compliance – Ensures reliable transactions.
✅ Joins & Relationships – Supports complex queries and relationships between tables.
✅ Strong Consistency – Guarantees that all transactions remain valid.
✅ Mature Ecosystem – Decades of optimization and tooling.

NOte :
Atomicity → A transaction is all or nothing (e.g., if payment processing fails, money isn't deducted).
Consistency → Database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.
Isolation → Multiple transactions don’t interfere with each other.
Durability → Once a transaction is committed, it is permanently saved, even if a system crashes.

Disadvantages:
--------------
❌ Scalability Challenges – Harder to scale horizontally; usually scales vertically.
❌ Fixed Schema – Changes in schema require migrations, which can be costly.
❌ Performance Issues – Can become slow with large-scale unstructured data.

Best Use Cases:
---------------
Banking & Finance (strong consistency needed).
E-commerce with transactions and inventory.
Applications requiring complex relationships (ERP, CRM).
Data analytics where SQL queries are essential.

2. NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational) :
-------------------------------------
NoSQL databases offer schema-less, scalable, and high-performance storage. 
They often follow BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent). 
Types include Document, Key-Value, Column-Family, and Graph databases.

Advantages:
✅ Flexible Schema – Can store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.
✅ High Scalability – Easily scales horizontally (distributed across multiple servers).
✅ Fast Reads/Writes – Optimized for high-throughput and real-time data.
✅ Varied Data Models – Supports key-value, document, column-family, and graph models.
✅ Good for Big Data – Handles large amounts of data efficiently.

Disadvantages:
❌ Eventual Consistency – Some NoSQL databases trade strict consistency for performance.
❌ Limited Querying – Lacks powerful SQL querying and JOIN support.
❌ Less Standardization – No universal NoSQL query language.
❌ Data Duplication – No normalization, leading to redundant data storage.

Best Use Cases:
Document Stores (MongoDB, CouchDB) → Flexible content management (e.g., blogs, user profiles).
Key-Value Stores (Redis, DynamoDB) → Caching, session storage, real-time applications.
Column-Family Stores (Cassandra, HBase) → Big data, event logging, analytics.
Graph Databases (Neo4j, ArangoDB) → Social networks, recommendation systems.

3. Hybrid Approach :
---------------------
Many modern applications use a hybrid approach:
    a. Use SQL for critical transactional data.
    b. Use NoSQL for real-time features, logging, caching, or large-scale unstructured data. 
    
Final Thoughts :
----------------
a. Go for SQL if you need strong consistency, complex queries, and structured data.
b. Go for NoSQL if you need scalability, flexibility, and high performance for unstructured data.
c. Hybrid solutions can leverage both strengths for an optimal system design.
