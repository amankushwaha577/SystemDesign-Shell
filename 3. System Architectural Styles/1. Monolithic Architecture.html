<!-- 
When designing software architectures, two primary approaches emerge: monolithic and microservices. 
Each has its advantages and trade-offs.

1. Monolithic Architecture :
----------------------------
A monolithic architecture is a traditional way of designing applications where all components (UI, business logic, database access, etc.) are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit.

Characteristics:
a. Single codebase.
b. Shared database.
c. All functionalities run as a single service.
d. Deployed as a single unit or application.

Advantages:
1. Simple Development & Deployment ✅ – Easier to develop, test, and deploy as everything is in one place.
2. Better Performance (initially)  ✅ – No network latency between components since they are all in the same process.
3. Easier Debugging                ✅ – Debugging and tracing issues is straightforward as everything is local.

Disadvantages:
1. Scalability Issues   ❌– Scaling means replicating the entire application, even if only one component needs more resources.
2. Slow Deployment      ❌– Any change requires redeploying the entire application.
3. Tightly Coupled      ❌– A failure in one module can bring down the entire application.
4. Difficult Maintenance❌– As the codebase grows, it becomes harder to manage and modify without breaking existing functionality.
