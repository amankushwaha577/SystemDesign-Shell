<!-- 
A microservices architecture breaks down an application into multiple small, independent services that communicate over a network. 

Characteristics:
1. Each service is independent and has its own database
2. Services communicate with each other using APIs (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.)
3. Each service is developed, deployed, and scaled independently

Advantages:
1. ✅ Scalability – Services can be scaled independently, optimizing resource usage.
2. ✅ Faster Development & Deployment – Teams can work on different services simultaneously without affecting others.
3. ✅ Fault Isolation – A failure in one service doesn’t bring down the entire system.
4. ✅ Technology Flexibility – Different services can use different tech stacks (e.g., Java for one service, Node.js for another).

Disadvantages:
1. ❌ Complexity – Managing multiple services, networking, and service discovery adds complexity.
2. ❌ Inter-Service Communication Overhead – API calls between services can introduce latency.
3. ❌ Distributed Data Management – Ensuring consistency across services is challenging.
4. ❌ Deployment & Monitoring Challenges – Requires DevOps expertise to manage CI/CD, monitoring, logging, etc.

Best for:
1. Large-scale applications with high scalability needs
2. Businesses requiring independent feature development
3. Applications with multiple teams working in parallel
4. Cloud-based, containerized, or serverless environments
