<!-- 
3. Event-Driven Model :
-----------------------
The Event-Driven Model is an asynchronous communication pattern.
where services communicate by emitting and responding to events instead of directly calling each other. 

Note : Events are generated when a change occurs, and other services react to these events without needing to know their source service.

Note : The sender and receiver service do not directly communicate with each other, 
       they don't know about each other,
       making the system loosely coupled and scalable.

Workflow:
--------
1. An event occurs : A user action, system change, or an external trigger (e.g., "Order Placed").
                     The event is sent to an Event Bus.
2. Event Bus (Kafka / RabbitMQ / AWS EventBridge) receives the event.
3. Subscribers listen to the event – Multiple services can consume the event and take independent actions.

Note : Services react asynchronously – Services process the event without blocking each other.
