2. Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub) Model :
-----------------------------------------
The Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub) Model is an asynchronous communication pattern.
where a publisher sends messages to a message broker, and subscribers receive those messages if they are subscribed to the topic. 

Note : The publisher and subscriber do not directly communicate with each other, 
       they don't know about each other,
       making the system loosely coupled and scalable.

How the Pub/Sub Model Works (Step-by-Step):
-----------------------------------------

a. Publisher Sends Messages :
   A publisher publishes a message to a "topic" in a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, Google Pub/Sub, Redis Pub/Sub).
   The message broker acts as an intermediary.

b. Message Broker Distributes Messages :
   The broker ensures messages are delivered to all interested subscribers who have subscribed to the topic.
   The publisher does not know who the subscribers are.

c. Subscribers Receive Messages
   Any service (subscriber) that has subscribed to the topic receives the message.
   Multiple subscribers can receive the same message.

                              (5) Processes the Message




Advantages:
✅ 1. Decoupling              – Publishers and subscribers don’t know about each other.
✅ 2. Scalability             – Any new service(subscriber) can be added easily.
✅ 3. Asynchronous Processing – No need to wait for an immediate response.

Disadvantages:
❌ 1. Message Loss        – If subscriber is offline, they will miss message.
❌ 2. Message Duplication - Message might be sent multiple time due to system failure. 
❌ 3. Message Ordering    - Message might not be in proper order if they are coming from different publisher. 
❌ 4. Complex Debugging   – Difficult to trace issues as services don’t directly communicate.
❌ 5. Latency             – Messages might be delayed if brokers are overloaded.

Best Use Cases:
1. Real-time notifications.
2. Log processing and monitoring.
3. Distributed systems with independent services.
