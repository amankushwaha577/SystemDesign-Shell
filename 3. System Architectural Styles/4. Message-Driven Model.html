<!-- 
In a Message-Driven Model, each message is processed by only one consumer, whereas in a Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Model,
multiple consumers receive the same message.

🔹 Message-Driven Model (Single Consumer Per Message) :
--------------------------------------------------------
📤 Producer (Order Service) → Message Queue → One Consumer (Payment Service) 📥
    a. A message queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) ensures that each message is delivered to only one consumer.
    b. Once a consumer processes the message, it is removed from the queue.
    Example:
    An order processing system where only one payment service processes each order.

🔹 Pub/Sub Model (Multiple Consumers Per Message) :
---------------------------------------------------
    a. A message broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Google Pub/Sub, Redis Pub/Sub) delivers a copy of the same message to multiple subscribers.
    b. Each subscriber gets an independent copy and processes it separately.
    Example:
    A user registration event where multiple services (email service, analytics service, notification service) need to act on the same event.


🔹 How It Works :
-----------------
1. Producer (Sender): Sends a message to a message queue.
2. Message Queue (Broker - RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, AWS SQS): Stores messages until they are consumed.
3. Consumer (Receiver): Listens to the queue and processes messages one by one.
4. Acknowledgment (Optional): Once processed, the consumer sends an acknowledgment to remove the message from the queue.
