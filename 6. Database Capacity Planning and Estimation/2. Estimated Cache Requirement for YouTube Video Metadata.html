Estimated Cache Requirement for YouTube Video Metadata :
------------------------------------------------------

YouTube caches video metadata (titles, descriptions, thumbnails, likes, views, etc.) to speed up searches and recommendations. Let’s estimate how much cache memory is needed.  

1️⃣ Metadata Size Per Video  
    Typical metadata fields for a single video:  
    | Field                  | Estimated Size  |  
    |------------------------|----------------|  
    | Video ID               | 16 bytes (UUID) |  
    | Title                  | 100 bytes       |  
    | Description            | 500 bytes       |  
    | Thumbnails             | 50 KB           |  
    | Tags                   | 200 bytes       |  
    | Views, Likes, Comments | 20 bytes       |  
    | Uploader Info          | 100 bytes       |  
    | Encoding Details       | 200 bytes       |  
    | **Total**              | **~52 KB per video** |  

2️⃣ Videos Served Per Second  
   a. Assume YouTube serves 100,000 video requests per second globally.  
   b. If each request needs metadata, the total cache requirement per second is:  

         100,000 videos × 52 KB = 5.2 GB/sec  

        i).  There are 86,400 seconds in a day (24 × 60 × 60).
        ii). Total metadata storage needed per day= 5.2 GB/sec × 86,400 sec/day
                                                  = 449,280 GB/day
                                                  = 449 TB/day

3️⃣ Cache Requirement for 24 Hours  
    a. YouTube should cache metadata for at least the most popular videos (e.g., last 24 hours).  
    b. Assume 200 million videos get views in a day.  
    c. Total metadata cache required:  

        200,000,000 videos × 52 KB = 10.4 TB  

Final Estimation:  
To optimize performance, YouTube may need **10-20 TB of cache** for video metadata in high-speed in-memory databases (like Redis or Memcached). 🚀

Estimating the Number of Nodes Required for Metadata Caching :

1️⃣ Choosing the Cache Node Type  
    a. Assume YouTube uses high-performance Redis or Memcached nodes.  
    b. A typical high-memory server has 256 GB RAM per node.  
    c. To ensure fast access, we assume all metadata is stored in memory (RAM).  

2️⃣ Number of Nodes Required  
    a. Total cache requirement per day: 449 TB = 449,000 GB  
    b. Each node can handle 256 GB of cached metadata.  

    Total nodes required = 449,000 GB / 256 GB per node  
                        ≈ 1,754 nodes  

3️⃣ Optimization with Replication & Eviction Policies  
    a. Replication (e.g., Master-Slave): For fault tolerance, YouTube likely keeps at least 2 replicas, meaning 3,508 nodes (1,754 × 2).  
    b. Eviction Strategies: Using Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction, YouTube caches only trending/popular videos, reducing total nodes required by 50-70%.  

👉 Final estimated nodes needed (after optimizations) = 1,000 - 1,500 nodes 🚀
