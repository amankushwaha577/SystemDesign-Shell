Estimated Cache Requirement for YouTube Video Metadata :
------------------------------------------------------

YouTube caches video metadata (titles, descriptions, thumbnails, likes, views, etc.) to speed up searches and recommendations. Let’s estimate how much cache memory is needed.  

1️⃣ Metadata Size Per Video  
    Typical metadata fields for a single video:  
    | Field                  | Estimated Size  |  
    |------------------------|----------------|  
    | Video ID               | 16 bytes (UUID) |  
    | Title                  | 100 bytes       |  
    | Description            | 500 bytes       |  
    | Thumbnails             | 50 KB           |  
    | Tags                   | 200 bytes       |  
    | Views, Likes, Comments | 20 bytes       |  
    | Uploader Info          | 100 bytes       |  
    | Encoding Details       | 200 bytes       |  
    | **Total**              | **~52 KB per video** |  

2️⃣ Cache Requirement for 24 Hours   
   a. Assume YouTube serves 100,000 video requests per second globally.  
   b. If each request needs metadata, the total cache requirement per second is:  

         100,000 videos × 52 KB = 5.2 GB/sec  

        i).  There are 86,400 seconds in a day (24 × 60 × 60).
        ii). Total metadata storage needed per day= 5.2 GB/sec × 86,400 sec/day
                                                  = 449,280 GB/day
                                                  = 449 TB/day

Final Estimation:  
To optimize performance, YouTube may need **500 - 800 TB of cache** for video metadata in high-speed in-memory databases (like Redis or Memcached). 🚀

Estimating the Number of Nodes Required for Metadata Caching :

1️⃣ Choosing the Cache Node Type  
    a. Assume YouTube uses high-performance Redis or Memcached nodes.  
    b. A typical high-memory server has 256 GB RAM per node.  
    c. To ensure fast access, we assume all metadata is stored in memory (RAM).  

2️⃣ Number of Nodes Required  
    a. Total cache requirement per day: 449 TB = 449,000 GB  
    b. Each node can handle 256 GB of cached metadata.  

    Total nodes required = 449,000 GB / 256 GB per node  
                        ≈ 1,754 nodes  

3️⃣ Optimization with Replication & Eviction Policies  
    a. Replication (e.g., Master-Slave): For fault tolerance, YouTube likely keeps at least 2 replicas, meaning 3,508 nodes (1,754 × 2).  
    b. Eviction Strategies: Using Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction, YouTube caches only trending/popular videos, reducing total nodes required by 50-70%.  

👉 Final estimated nodes needed (after optimizations) = 1,000 - 1,500 nodes 🚀

Estimating the Number of Processors Required for Metadata Caching  

1️⃣ Choosing the Cache Node Type :
   a. Each cache node is assumed to have **256 GB RAM** and a high-performance CPU.  
   b. Modern cache servers typically use **16-core CPUs** (e.g., Intel Xeon or AMD EPYC).  

2️⃣ Processing Power Per Node :
   a. A single Redis/Memcached node with **16 cores** can handle ~200,000 requests per second.  
        i).  Since one node can handle 200,000 requests/sec, in theory, one node would be enough.
        ii). But in reality, we distribute the load for fault tolerance and availability.
        iii).But, We estimated 1,500 cache nodes earlier to store 449 TB of metadata cache.

3️⃣ Total Requests Per Second :
   a. YouTube serves **100,000 video metadata requests per second** globally.  
   b. To handle redundancy and spikes, we assume a buffer and plan for **200,000 requests/sec**.  

4️⃣ Number of Processor Required (Reality (without fault tolerante)) :
   a. Each node is 16 cores CPU. So Each node can handle 200,000 requests/sec.  
   b. Total Processor required = 200,000 / 200,000 = **1 Processor (in theory)**  

   However, for **fault tolerance and distributed architecture**, we use **1,500 cache nodes** (from previous estimation).  

5️⃣ Number of Processors Required (fault tolerante) :
   a. If each node has a **16-core CPU**, then:  

   b. Total cores required = 1,500 nodes × 16 cores per node  
                           = **24,000 CPU cores**  

👉 **Final estimation: YouTube needs ~24,000 CPU cores** for metadata caching globally. 🚀
