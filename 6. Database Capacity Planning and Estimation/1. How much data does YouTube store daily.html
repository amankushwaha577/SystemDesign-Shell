How Much Data Does YouTube Store in One Day?  
--------------------------------------------

YouTube handles an enormous volume of video uploads every day. 
To estimate the total storage required per day, we break it down step by step.  

1️⃣ Video Upload Rate  :  
-----------------------
   According to recent estimates, YouTube receives "500 hours of video uploads per minute" from users worldwide.  
   The average file size for 1 hour of 1080p HD video is around 2.5 GB.

2️⃣ Estimating Storage Per Minute :
---------------------------------
    a. The average file size for 1 hour of 1080p HD video is around 2.5 GB.  
       Ex : The file size of a video depends on factors like resolution, codec, and bitrate. Using H.264 codec, we estimate:
                360p (Low Quality): ~300 MB per hour
                720p (HD): ~1 GB per hour
                1080p (Full HD): ~2 GB per hour
                4K (Ultra HD): ~10 GB per hour
        Assuming an average mix of 1080p and 720p content, we approximate 2.5 GB per hour.

    b. Since 500 hours of video are uploaded per minute, the total size per minute is:  
       The total size per minute is => 500 hours × 2.5 GB/hour = 1250 GB/min (or 1.25 TB/min)  

3️⃣ Estimating Storage Per Day :
------------------------------
    a. There are 1440 minutes in a day, so:  
    b. 1.25 TB/min × 1440 min/day = 1800 TB/day (or 1.8 PB/day)  

4️⃣ Factors Affecting Storage :
------------------------------
    While the raw data estimate is 1.8 PB/day, the actual storage YouTube needs is higher due to:  

    ✔️ Multiple Resolutions: YouTube stores each video in various formats (144p, 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 4K, 8K), increasing storage needs.  
    ✔️ Metadata & Thumbnails: Each video has associated metadata like titles, descriptions, subtitles, and user interactions.  
    ✔️ Backup & Redundancy: YouTube stores data in multiple data centers for reliability and disaster recovery.  
    ✔️ Compression & Optimization: YouTube uses advanced compression techniques (VP9, AV1) to reduce file sizes.  

Final Answer:  
YouTube stores approximately 1.8 PB of new data every day, but with multiple resolutions, backups, and metadata, 
the actual storage requirement may exceed 3-5 PB per day.
