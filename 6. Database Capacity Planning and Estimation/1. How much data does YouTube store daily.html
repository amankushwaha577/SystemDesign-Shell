How Much Data Does YouTube Store in One Day?  
--------------------------------------------

YouTube handles an enormous volume of video uploads every day. 
To estimate the total storage required per day, we break it down step by step.  

1️⃣ Video Upload Rate  :  
   According to recent estimates, YouTube receives "500 hours of video uploads per minute" from users worldwide.  

2️⃣ Estimating Storage Per Minute :
    a. The average file size for 1 hour of 1080p HD video is around 2.5 GB.  
    b. Since 500 hours of video are uploaded per minute, the total size per minute is:  

       The total size per minute is => 500 hours × 2.5 GB/hour = 1250 GB/min (or 1.25 TB/min)  

3️⃣ Estimating Storage Per Day :
    a. There are 1440 minutes in a day, so:  
    b. 1.25 TB/min × 1440 min/day = 1800 TB/day (or 1.8 PB/day)  

4️⃣ Factors Affecting Storage  
    While the raw data estimate is 1.8 PB/day, the actual storage YouTube needs is higher due to:  

    ✔️ Multiple Resolutions: YouTube stores each video in various formats (144p, 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 4K, 8K), increasing storage needs.  
    ✔️ Metadata & Thumbnails: Each video has associated metadata like titles, descriptions, subtitles, and user interactions.  
    ✔️ Backup & Redundancy: YouTube stores data in multiple data centers for reliability and disaster recovery.  
    ✔️ Compression & Optimization: YouTube uses advanced compression techniques (VP9, AV1) to reduce file sizes.  

Final Answer:  
YouTube stores approximately 1.8 PB of new data every day, but with multiple resolutions, backups, and metadata, the actual storage requirement may exceed 3-5 PB per day.
