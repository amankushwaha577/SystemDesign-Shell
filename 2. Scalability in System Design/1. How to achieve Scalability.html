Scalability refers to a system's ability to handle increased load efficiently by expanding its resources. 
A scalable system ensures smooth performance even as user traffic, data volume, or processing demands grow. 

How to Achieve Scalability?:-
----------------------------

1. Efficient Architecture Design
    a. Our Architecture should have Microservices instead of a monolithic structure.
    b. We have to Apply load balancing to distribute requests evenly.
    c. We have to Implement caching at various levels (like - CDN, Redis, Memcached).
    d. We have to Use asynchronous processing with message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka).

2. Database Optimization
    a. Replication: Duplicate databases for high availability.
    b. Sharding: Split data across multiple databases.
    c. Indexing & Query Optimization: Speed up search operations.

3. Use Scalable Infrastructure
    a. Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) offer auto-scaling solutions.
    b. Use containers & orchestration tools (Docker, Kubernetes).
    c. Implement serverless computing for event-driven workloads.

4. CDN and Edge Computing
    a. Serve static content using CDNs (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront).
    b. Deploy services closer to users via Edge Computing.
