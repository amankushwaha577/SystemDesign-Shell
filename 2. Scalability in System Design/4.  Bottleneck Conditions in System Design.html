🚨 Bottleneck Conditions in System Design :
A bottleneck is a limiting factor in system performance that slows down the entire process. 
It can exist in databases, networks, servers, authentication, third-party services, code execution, or data storage. 

1️⃣ DATABASE BOTTLENECKS  
🔴 Problem: Slow queries, inefficient indexing, high read/write latency.  
⚠️ Causes:  
✔ Poor indexing strategies  
✔ High contention on a single database instance  
✔ Inefficient query structure  
✔ Lack of caching  

✅ Solutions:  
🔹 Use indexes and query optimization.  
🔹 Implement sharding and read replicas.  
🔹 Use caching layers like Redis or Memcached.  

------------------------------------------

2️⃣ NETWORK BOTTLENECKS  
🔴 Problem: Slow data transfer, high latency, or packet loss.  
⚠️ Causes:  
✔ Limited bandwidth  
✔ High network congestion  
✔ Inefficient request routing  

✅ Solutions:  
🔹 Use CDNs to cache static content.  
🔹 Implement load balancing.  
🔹 Optimize API calls with pagination and batching.  

------------------------------------------

3️⃣ SERVER BOTTLENECKS  
🔴 Problem: High CPU/memory usage, frequent crashes, slow response time.  
⚠️ Causes:  
✔ Too many concurrent requests hitting a single server  
✔ Poor resource allocation  
✔ Inefficient background jobs  

✅ Solutions:  
🔹 Scale horizontally with load balancers.  
🔹 Implement server-side caching.  
🔹 Optimize backend processing with asynchronous programming.  

------------------------------------------

4️⃣ AUTHENTICATION BOTTLENECKS  
🔴 Problem: Slow login processing, delayed authentication responses.  
⚠️ Causes:  
✔ Overloaded authentication server  
✔ Frequent database calls for user verification  
✔ Inefficient session management  

✅ Solutions:  
🔹 Use JWT or OAuth instead of traditional sessions.  
🔹 Store sessions in Redis instead of databases.  
🔹 Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.  

------------------------------------------

5️⃣ THIRD-PARTY SERVICES BOTTLENECKS  
🔴 Problem: Slow API responses, dependency failures.  
⚠️ Causes:  
✔ Reliance on external APIs with unpredictable latency  
✔ Limited API rate limits  

✅ Solutions:  
🔹 Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.  
🔹 Implement request retries with exponential backoff.  
🔹 Cache frequent API responses.  

------------------------------------------

6️⃣ CODE EXECUTION BOTTLENECKS  
🔴 Problem: Slow function execution, high CPU/memory usage.  
⚠️ Causes:  
✔ Inefficient algorithms  
✔ Blocking I/O operations  

✅ Solutions:  
🔹 Optimize code execution using profilers.  
🔹 Use efficient data structures.  
🔹 Implement asynchronous/non-blocking operations.  

------------------------------------------

7️⃣ DATA STORAGE BOTTLENECKS  
🔴 Problem: Slow read/write operations, high disk I/O.  
⚠️ Causes:  
✔ Using HDD instead of SSD  
✔ No partitioning or sharding  

✅ Solutions:  
🔹 Use SSD storage.  
🔹 Implement database partitioning and sharding.  
🔹 Archive and purge old data.  

------------------------------------------

🔍 Final Thoughts:  
Bottlenecks can cripple system performance if not addressed early. The best way to avoid bottlenecks is by:  
✔ Load testing before deployment (JMeter, k6)  
✔ Observability tools (Grafana, Prometheus)  
✔ Distributed tracing (Zipkin, OpenTelemetry)
