<!-- 
🚨 Bottleneck Conditions in System Design :
A bottleneck is a limiting factor in system performance that slows down the entire process. 
It can exist in databases, networks, servers, authentication, third-party services, code execution, or data storage. 

1️⃣ Database Bottlenecks – Slow queries, high read/write latency.
✅ Solutions: Indexing, caching (Redis), sharding, query optimization.

2️⃣ Network Bottlenecks – High latency, limited bandwidth.
✅ Solutions: CDN, load balancing, compression, API optimization.

3️⃣ Server Bottlenecks – High CPU/memory usage, request overload.
✅ Solutions: Horizontal scaling, caching, async processing, message queues.

4️⃣ Authentication Bottlenecks – Slow login responses, overloaded auth servers.
✅ Solutions: JWT, Redis session storage, rate limiting, async auth processing.

5️⃣ Third-party Services Bottlenecks – API rate limits, slow external dependencies.
✅ Solutions: Circuit breakers, request retries, caching, fallback mechanisms.

6️⃣ Code Execution Bottlenecks – Slow algorithms, blocking I/O.
✅ Solutions: Profiling, efficient data structures, async processing, optimized queries.

7️⃣ Data Storage Bottlenecks – Slow read/write, high disk I/O.
✅ Solutions: SSD storage, sharding, partitioning, data archiving.
