API Design in System Design :
---------------------------
API design is a crucial part of system design, ensuring efficient, scalable, and maintainable communication 
between different components of a system. 

Types of APIs :
-----------------
1. RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) :
    a. Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    b. Follows a stateless architecture.
    c. Uses JSON or XML for data exchange.
    d. Example: GET /users/{id} → Fetch user details.

2. GraphQL APIs :
    a. Clients request exactly the data they need.
    b. Uses a single endpoint (/graphql).
    c. Example: Query to fetch a user and their posts in one request.

3. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) :
    a. Uses Protocol Buffers (binary format, smaller & faster).
    b. Good for microservices communication.
    Example: getUser(id: 123) → User.

4. WebSockets & Streaming APIs
    Used for real-time communication (chats, notifications).
    Example: ws://chat.example.com → Live chat updates.
