<!-- 
The CAP Theorem states that a system can only guarantee two of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.  

1. Consistency (C) :
-------------------
a. Every node in the system must have same data at the same time. 
   This is because the nodes are constantly communicating with each other and sharing updates. 
b. Every read operation of client must receive either i).  The most latest write 
                                                      ii). Or an error.

   Example: Traditional Relational Databases (RDBMS) ensure strong consistency.

2. Availability (A) :
--------------------
a. The system remains operational even if some nodes down.The system never rejects requests due to node failures.
b. All the working nodes have to be able to respond to queries.
   (It does't matter data in DB is updated one or not.)
   
c. Every read/write request receives a response whether i). Successful 
                                                       ii). Or an error.
    
   Example: Amazon DynamoDB prioritizes high availability.

3. Partition Tolerance (P) :
---------------------------
a. if network failures split the entire system into isolated partitions. The system continues to operate.
   [In a distributed system, network failures are inevitable, so partition tolerance is mandatory.]
b. But Here we need to choose either Consistency / Availability.
   i).  If You choose "Consistency"  => you will become Unavailable.
   ii). If You choose "Availability" => you will become InConsistent.

   If you want consistency  just Reject Request. Say Service is Unavailable. So there will be no read/write operation.
   if you want availability just accept Request. Say I am Available. So there will be read/write operation but DB's will be inconsistent because of Partitions.

   Example: Apache Cassandra handles partition tolerance well.

<!-- 
1. Suppose We are making a Application where clients can upload their documents.
2. Suppose our application got hit and got lakhs of hit.
3. Now we decided to Horizontally scale our application to improve the capacity.
   (Let suppose Me and Hardik will maintain 2 diaries (means:servers).

4. CONSISTENCY :
   ------------
   Now a client write request Req1 comes to service-1 with payload of a Adhaar card document.
   Now Adhaar document is stored inside DB of Server1.
   Here Now we will add this adhaar copy to DB of Service-2 to maintain "CONSISTENCY".

                                Service-1                   Service-2
                                    |                           |
                                ---------                   ---------
                                |       |                   |       |                      
                                |   DB  | <-Both in Sync -> |   DB  |
                                |       |                   |       |
          Write  Req1 ----- ->  ---------                   ---------  
     (Payload - Adhaar Card)   

                                 Service-1                   Service-2
                                    |                           |
                                ---------                   ---------
                                | Adhaar|                   | Adhaar|                      
                                |  Card | <-Both in Sync -> |  Card |
                                |       |                   |       |
          read  Req1 ----- - >  ---------                   ---------  
    
    It's called consistency : If read request comes to Service-1 or Service-2 for this AdhaarCard
                              Than both will return same output (AdhaarCard). 

5. Availability (A) :
   ------------------
    Let suppose Service of Hardik goes down than also our system will remains operational.
    The system will never reject requests due to node failures.
    we will happily take requests in service-1.
                                Service-1                   Service-2
                                    |                           |
                                ---------                   ---------
                                |       |                   |       |                      
                                |   DB  |    ------  --     |   DB  |
                                |       |                   |       |
                                ---------                   ---------  
                                                              ❌❌
    Service-1 will take request read/write.
    It does't matter data in DB is updated one or not.
    
    When failure node goes live it will communicate latest data from live node.
    
                              
6. Partition Tolerance (P) :
   ------------------------
   Suppose network failure splits our system into 2 isolated partitions.
   Than our system continues to operate.

                                Service-1                   Service-2
                                    |                           |
                                ---------                   ---------
                                |       |                   |       |                      
                                |   DB  |    ---❌❌--     |   DB  |
                                |       |                   |       |
                                ---------                   ---------  
                              Partition 1                   Partition 2

    But we need to choose either consistency or Availability.
    If you choose -
    -------------
    A. Consistency : If you want consistency just Reject Request. Say Service is Unavailable.
                     (Because Nodes are not communicating they are separated).
                     If we write in Service-1 than Service-2 will become inconsistent.

    B. Availability: If you want availability just accept Request. 
                     But both services will become inconsistent.
                     (Because Nodes are not communicating they are separated).

    If You choose "Consistency"  => you will become Unavailable.
    If You choose "Availability" => you will become InConsistent.
