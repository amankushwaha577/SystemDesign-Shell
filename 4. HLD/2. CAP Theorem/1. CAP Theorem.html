<!-- 
The CAP Theorem states that a system can only guarantee two of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.  

1. Consistency (C) :
-------------------
a. Every node in the system must have same data at the same time. 
   This is because the nodes are constantly communicating with each other and sharing updates. 
b. Every read operation of client must receive either i).  The most latest write 
                                                      ii). Or an error.

   Example: Traditional Relational Databases (RDBMS) ensure strong consistency.

2. Availability (A) :
--------------------
a. The system remains operational even if some nodes fail.
   If some nodes in the system are down. The system never rejects requests due to node failures.
b. All the working nodes have to be able to respond to queries and answer even if it is with wrong or old data.
c. Every read/write request receives a response whether i). Successful 
                                                       ii). Or an error.
   
    
   Example: Amazon DynamoDB prioritizes high availability.

<!-- 
1. Suppose We are making a Application where clients can upload their documents.
2. Suppose our application got hit and got lakhs of hit.
3. Now we decided to Horizontally scale our application to improve the capacity.
   (Let suppose Me and Hardik will maintain 2 diaries (means:servers).

4. CONSISTENCY :
   ------------
   Now a client write request Req1 comes to service-1 with payload of a Adhaar card document.
   Now Adhaar document is stored inside DB of Server1.
   Here Now we will add this adhaar copy to DB of Service-2 to maintain "CONSISTENCY".

                                Service-1                   Service-2
                                    |                           |
                                ---------                   ---------
                                |       |                   |       |                      
                                |   DB  | <-Both in Sync -> |   DB  |
                                |       |                   |       |
          Write  Req1 ----- ->  ---------                   ---------  
     (Payload - Adhaar Card)   

                                 Service-1                   Service-2
                                    |                           |
                                ---------                   ---------
                                | Adhaar|                   | Adhaar|                      
                                |  Card | <-Both in Sync -> |  Card |
                                |       |                   |       |
          read  Req1 ----- - >  ---------                   ---------  
    
    It's called consistency : If read request comes to Service-1 or Service-2 for this AdhaarCard
                              Than both will return same output (AdhaarCard).
