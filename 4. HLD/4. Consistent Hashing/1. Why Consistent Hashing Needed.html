Consistent Hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to achieve load balancing.
while minimizing rehashing when nodes are added or removed. 

It is widely used in distributed caching, distributed databases and load balancing. 


Why is Consistent Hashing Needed?
---------------------------------
In a traditional modulo-based hashing system for Load Balancing:

    If there are N servers, a key (request) is assigned to a server using:
    [ server_index where request will go = hash(key) % N ]

When a server is added or removed, almost all keys need to be remapped, causing high overhead.
Consistent Hashing solves this problem by minimizing remapping when the number of servers changes.

Example :
 let r1 => 10     let N = 4 (Total Number of Servers)
     r2 => 20     r1,r2,r3 = Incoming Request on System
     r3 => 30

     Sever_Index  for r1 = hash(r1) % 4 =  hash(10) % 4  = 3 % 4  =>  3
     Sever_Index  for r2 = hash(r2) % 4 =  hash(20) % 4  = 15 % 4  => 3
     Sever_Index  for r3 = hash(r3) % 4 =  hash(30) % 4  = 20 % 4  => 0

     r3  ------------ > |🗄️ Server 0 |

                        |🗄️ Server 1 |

                        |🗄️ Server 2 |

     r1, r2 --------- > |🗄️ Server 3 |

Suppose our server become famous we introduced a new server for handeling more load.
Now N = 5   

     Sever_Index  for r1 = hash(r1) % 4 =  hash(10) % 5  = 3 % 5  =>  3
     Sever_Index  for r2 = hash(r2) % 4 =  hash(20) % 5  = 15 % 5  => 0
     Sever_Index  for r3 = hash(r3) % 4 =  hash(30) % 5  = 20 % 5  => 2

     r2  ----------- >  |🗄️ Server 0 |

                        |🗄️ Server 1 |

     r3 ------------ >  |🗄️ Server 2 |

     r1 -- --------- >  |🗄️ Server 3 |

                        |🗄️ Server 4 |

    OBSERVE : Now because of this normal hashing policy entire system has changed.
              r3, r2 unncessarily changed its server.
              Entire cache in sever is useless now.
              Server 0 have cache of r3 ie. Useless now.
              Server 3 have cache of r2 ie. Useless now.
