Disadvantages Of Using cache :

1. Extra Latency for Cache Lookup : Though cache speeds up retrieval, it adds a small overhead.
   - Example: Suppose data is not available in Cache, Server still needs to check cache first, which adds a few milliseconds.

                                      |Cache |
                                      +------+

    Total Time =     100 * 2 +          1 * 2 +       10 * 2 +       = 222ms

                                         ||
                                         ||
                                          ------- > Even data is not available in cache but it is still cheched. 

2. Stale Data : Cached data might be outdated if not refreshed properly.
   - If data is updated in the DB, but cache is not refreshed, users get old data.
   - Extra logic is needed to keep cache in sync with the database.

3. Memory Overhead : Storing cached data consumes extra memory.
   - More memory is required to store frequently used data.
   - Expensive servers might be needed for large-scale caching.

4. Cache Invalidation Complexity : Deciding when to remove or refresh cache is difficult.
   - Common strategies: TTL (Time-to-Live), LRU (Least Recently Used).
   - Improper invalidation can lead to inconsistent data.

5. Cold Start Problem : Initial requests might be slow if cache is empty.
   - The first request always goes to the DB since cache is not populated yet.
   - If cache is frequently flushed, cold starts become common.

6. Security Issues : Cached sensitive data may be exposed.
   - If not secured, attackers can access cached user details or session data.

7. Replication and Consistency : Distributed caching adds complexity.
   - Multiple caches in different locations need to sync.
   - If not handled properly, users might see inconsistent results.
