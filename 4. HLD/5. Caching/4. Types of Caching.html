<!-- 
Types of Caching in System Design
---------------------------------

🔹 1. Client-Side Caching :
    Cached at the user's device (browser, mobile app, or local storage).
    Example: Browsers cache static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images to speed up website loading.

🔹 2. Server-Side Caching
    Cached at the backend server or application level.
    Example: API responses cached at the application level to reduce redundant database queries.

🔹 3. Database Caching
    Cached frequently accessed database queries to speed up reads.
    Example: Instagram app caching user profiles to avoid querying the database repeatedly.

🔹 4. Distributed Caching
    Cache is spread across multiple servers for better scalability and fault tolerance.
    Example: Redis Cluster, Memcached in cloud-based applications.
