<!-- 
Cache Eviction Policies :
-------------------------
Since cache has limited space, older data must be removed using eviction policies:

✅ 1. Least Recently Used (LRU) –   Removes the least accessed data first.
✅ 2. Least Frequently Used (LFU) – Removes the data that is used the least.
✅ 3. First-In-First-Out (FIFO) –   Oldest cached items are removed first.
✅ 4. Time-To-Live (TTL) –          Data expires after a specific time.
