What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network)? :
--------------------------------------------
A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of distributed servers that cache and deliver content 
(such as images, videos, scripts, and web pages) from locations closer to users, reducing latency and improving load times. 

CDN : Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Akamai, and Fastly.

How a CDN Works :
-----------------
Client  →  Browser Cache (✅) → Serve Response  
           ⬇
           ⬇ (Cache Miss)  
           ⬇
          DNS  →  CDN (✅) → Serve Response  
           ⬇
           ⬇ (Cache Miss)  
           ⬇
          API Gateway  →  Load Balancer  →  Service 
           ⬇ 
           ⬇ (Check Cache)  
           ⬇
          Redis (✅) → Serve Response 
           ⬇ 
           ⬇ (Cache Miss)  
           ⬇
          Database → Store in Cache → Serve Response  

1️⃣ Client Requests Data
        The browser first checks its local cache.
        ✅ If cached, the response is served immediately.
        ❌ If not cached, the request continues.

2️⃣ DNS Resolves the Domain
         DNS converts the domain name to an IP address.

3️⃣ CDN (Content Delivery Network) Checks for Cached Response
        ✅ If cached, the CDN serves the response without hitting the backend.
        ❌ If not cached, the request moves to the backend.
        
4️⃣ API Gateway Processes the Request
        The request reaches the API Gateway, which handles authentication, rate limiting, and routing.

5️⃣ Load Balancer Distributes the Request
        The Load Balancer sends the request to the appropriate backend service.

6️⃣ Service Checks Redis Cache for Data
        ✅ If the data exists in Redis, the response is served from cache.
        ❌ If not found in Redis, the request moves to the database.

7️⃣ Database Query for Data
        The database retrieves the requested data.
        The data is stored in Redis for future requests.
        The final response is sent back to the client.


Benefits of Using a CDN :
------------------------
✅ Faster Load Times – Content loads quickly from a nearby server.
✅ Reduced Server Load – Fewer requests reach the main server.
✅ Better Scalability – Can handle high traffic easily.
✅ DDoS Protection – CDN absorbs malicious traffic.
✅ Lower Bandwidth Costs – Cached content reduces origin server data transfer.


Disadvantages of CDN :
----------------------
❌ Cost – Premium CDNs charge for traffic and storage.
❌ Cache Invalidation Issues – Updates may not reflect immediately.
❌ Regional Availability – Some regions may not have CDN nodes.
