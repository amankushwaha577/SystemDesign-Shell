Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming requests or workload evenly across multiple servers
to prevent overload on any single server and ensure high availability, reliability, and performance.

Why is Load Balancing Important?
--------------------------------
✅ Prevents Overload – If one server gets too many requests, it might slow down or crash. Load balancing spreads the traffic across multiple servers.
✅ Improves Fault Tolerance – If a server fails, requests can be rerouted to healthy servers.
✅ Enhances Scalability – As demand increases, new servers can be added without affecting performance.
✅ Optimizes Resource Usage – Ensures that no single server is underutilized while others are overloaded.

How Load Balancing Works?
---------------------------
A load balancer sits between clients and servers, distributing requests efficiently. There are different types of load balancing:

1️⃣ DNS Load Balancing – Uses DNS to map requests to different servers.
2️⃣ Round Robin – Requests are sent to each server in a circular order.
3️⃣ Least Connections – The server with the fewest active connections gets the next request.
4️⃣ Weighted Load Balancing – Assigns more traffic to powerful servers.
5️⃣ Consistent Hashing – Maps requests to servers based on a hash function (used in distributed databases & caching).

Real-World Applications of Load Balancing :
------------------------------------------
✅ CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) – Distribute website traffic across multiple data centers worldwide.
✅ Database Replication – Distribute read queries across multiple database replicas.
✅ Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, GCP) – Automatically scale resources based on demand.
✅ Microservices Architecture – Routes traffic efficiently to different services in a distributed system.

Example :
---------
Imagine you have 3 servers and a load balancer handling web requests:
a. The Load Balancer ensures each server gets a fair share of requests.
b. If Server 2 crashes, the load balancer redirects traffic to Server 1 & 3 automatically.
