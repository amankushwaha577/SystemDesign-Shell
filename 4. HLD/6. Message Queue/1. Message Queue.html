What is a Message Queue? ::
---------------------------
A Message Queue (MQ) is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication that allows 
messages to be sent between different parts of a system without them being directly connected. 

By separating message producers (senders) and consumers (receivers), message queues provide 
a. scalability, 
b. fault tolerance, 
c. and load balancing.


Why Use a Message Queue?
-------------------------
1. Asynchronous Processing: Enables background processing without blocking the main application flow.
2. Decoupling: Producers and consumers do not need to interact directly.
3. Scalability: Enables load balancing by distributing messages across multiple consumers.
4. Fault Tolerance & Reliability: Ensures messages are not lost due to system failures.



Key Components:
---------------
1. Producer: Generates and sends messages to the queue.
2. Queue: Stores messages temporarily until they are processed.
3, Consumer: Retrieves and processes messages from the queue.
4. Broker(Optional): Manages the communication between producers and consumers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS).

Note :
Acknowledgment (Optional): In some message queue systems, consumers can send acknowledgments back to the queue, 
indicating that they have successfully processed a message. 
This is essential for ensuring message delivery and preventing message loss.



Message Queue Patterns :
-----------------------
1. Point-to-Point (P2P): A single consumer processes each message.
2. Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub): Multiple consumers receive the same message.
3. Work Queue: Distributes messages among multiple consumers for parallel processing.
4. Delayed Message Queue: Messages are processed after a specified delay.
